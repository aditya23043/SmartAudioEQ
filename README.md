## Types of Power Amplifiers

### Class A

- High Linearity
- Very little distortion
- Low efficiency
  - Inefficient
  - Lot of heat generated

### Class B

- Higher efficiency
- Significant distortion
- Push-pull configuration
  - Each transistor dealing with each half of the input waveform

### Class AB

- Most common type of amp
- Moderate efficiency
- Moderate distortion

### Class C

- High efficiency
- High distortion

### Class D

- High efficiency
- Uses pulse width modulation
